Prolog & AI Logic Programming Examples
This repository contains a curated collection of Prolog programs that showcase the application of logic programming in solving classical Artificial Intelligence (AI) problems. Designed to be run via DOSBox or any standard Prolog interpreter, these examples cover everything from recursion and list processing to game logic, search strategies, and expert systems.

📌 Highlights
✅ Basic Prolog Concepts
Use of cut (!) predicate to control backtracking
Implementation of recursive logic
List handling and computation of list length


🧠 Knowledge Representation
Medical diagnosis system using rule-based inference
Password authentication through Prolog facts and rules


🔍 Search Algorithms
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Water Jug Problem using logical state transitions


🎮 Games and Strategy
Full Tic Tac Toe game with turn-based AI logic
Game state evaluation, move validation, and victory condition checks


➗ Mathematical Logic
Recursive factorial calculation supporting positive and negative integers


🔍 Sample Topics & Problems
#	Topic	Description
1	Cut Predicate	Demonstrates pruning of search trees using !
2	Recursion	Simple recursive summation of list elements
3	List Handling	Measures the length of a list using recursion
4	DFS & BFS	Graph traversal algorithms implemented with Prolog rules
5	Medical Expert System	Rule-based expert system for disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions
6	Water Jug Problem	Solves the classic AI jug puzzle using logical state transitions
7	Tic Tac Toe	Interactive AI-based game logic in a turn-based system
8	Authentication	Validates login credentials using Prolog facts
9	Factorial Calculation	Recursive logic supporting both positive and negative integers


🛠️ How to Run
You can run these programs using any standard Prolog environment:


📥 Prerequisites
SWI-Prolog or
DOSBox with a compatible Prolog setup


▶️ Execution Steps
Open your Prolog environment.
Load the desired file:
?- [filename].
Run a query, for example:
?- sumlist([1,2,3], X).


🤖 Applications
