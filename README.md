üß† Prolog & AI Logic Programming Examples
This repository contains a curated collection of Prolog programs that demonstrate the power of logic programming in the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These programs cover fundamental AI concepts, from recursion and list processing to game theory and diagnostic systems.

üìå Highlights
Basic Prolog Concepts
Use of cut predicate for controlling backtracking.
Implementation of recursion with practical examples.
List handling and length computation.


Knowledge Representation
Medical diagnosis system that simulates symptom-based disease detection and treatment suggestion.
Password authentication system to demonstrate simple user validation logic.


Search Algorithms
Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) using logical relations.
Water Jug Problem solver using rule-based state transitions.


Games and Strategy
Full implementation of Tic Tac Toe game with AI decision-making.
Game state evaluation, victory condition checks, and move validation.


Mathematical Logic
Recursive computation of factorials for both positive and negative integers.

üîç Sample Topics & Problems
#	Topic	Description
1	Cut Predicate	Demonstrates how Prolog uses cut (!) to prune search trees.
2	Recursion	Simple recursive logic for summing a list.
3	List Handling	Measures length of a list using recursion.
4	DFS & BFS	Classic AI graph traversal algorithms implemented in Prolog.
5	Medical Expert System	A mini rule-based expert system for diagnosis.
6	Water Jug Problem	Solves the classic AI jug puzzle using state transitions.
7	Tic Tac Toe	Turn-based logic for building an interactive AI game.
8	Authentication	Validates user login credentials through Prolog facts.
9	Factorial Calculation	Factorial logic supporting both positive and negative integers.


üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
To run the programs:
Use any Prolog interpreter such as SWI-Prolog.

Load the file using:prolog
?- [filename].
Execute the desired query:

prolog
?- sumlist([1,2,3], X).
